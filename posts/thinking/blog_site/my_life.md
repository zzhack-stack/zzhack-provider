Recently I was re-watched a movie which is one of my favorite movies, called <Into the wild>, as u can see the cover is scene from the movie. there r so many lines in this movie that I reallt like, for instance the "Super tramp" said:

<h1>If u want something in life, just reach out and grab it.</h1>
